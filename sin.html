<h2 id="mortal-venial">Mortal and Venial Sin</h2>

<h3>Mortal Sin</h3>
<p>Mortal sin destroys the life of grace in the soul, turns the soul away from God (its ultimate end), and renders the soul deserving of eternal punishment in hell. A single unrepented mortal sin suffices for damnation.</p>
<blockquote>"The wages of sin is death." — Romans 6:23</blockquote>
<p>Mortal sin can only be forgiven through the Sacrament of Penance (or, in extraordinary circumstances, by an act of perfect contrition with the firm resolve to confess as soon as possible).</p>

<h3>Venial Sin</h3>
<p>Venial sin wounds the soul and weakens grace but does not destroy it. It does not turn the soul entirely from God but represents a disordered attachment to created goods. Venial sin disposes the soul toward mortal sin and incurs temporal punishment (to be satisfied in this life or in Purgatory).</p>
<p>Venial sins can be remitted through acts of contrition, reception of the Holy Eucharist, the use of sacramentals (holy water, etc.), prayer, and works of charity — though confession of venial sins is strongly encouraged.</p>
<p class="source">Cf. St. Thomas Aquinas, <em>Summa Theologica</em>, I-II, q. 72; Council of Trent, Session VI, Canons 23–25, 27.</p>

<h2 id="conditions">The Three Conditions for Mortal Sin</h2>
<p>For a sin to be mortal, <strong>all three</strong> of the following conditions must be present simultaneously:</p>

<h3>1. Grave Matter (<em>Materia Gravis</em>)</h3>
<p>The act must involve a serious violation of God's law. The Ten Commandments provide the primary guide for what constitutes grave matter. Not every sin involves grave matter — the distinction depends on the nature and object of the act.</p>

<h3>2. Full Knowledge (<em>Plena Advertentia</em>)</h3>
<p>The person must know, or be reasonably expected to know, that the act is gravely sinful. Vincible (culpable) ignorance — ignorance that could and should have been overcome — does not excuse. Only truly invincible ignorance (which the person could not have overcome) may diminish culpability.</p>

<h3>3. Deliberate Consent (<em>Plenus Consensus</em>)</h3>
<p>The person must freely and willingly choose to commit the act. Factors that diminish freedom — such as grave fear, force, habit (though habit itself can be culpable), passion, or psychological compulsion — may reduce a mortal sin to a venial sin, though they do not necessarily remove all guilt.</p>

<p class="note">If any one of these three conditions is absent, the sin is venial rather than mortal. However, one must be careful not to use this as a pretext for self-excuse: the presumption of innocence does not extend to the habitual rationalizer.</p>

<p class="source">Cf. <em>Summa Theologica</em>, I-II, q. 88, a. 1–6; Roman Catechism, Part III.</p>

<h2 id="deadly">The Seven Deadly (Capital) Sins</h2>
<p>The seven capital sins are called "deadly" or "capital" not because each instance is necessarily mortal, but because they are the root vices from which all other sins spring (<em>capita</em> = "heads" or "sources").</p>

<h3>1. Pride (<em>Superbia</em>)</h3>
<p>The disordered love of one's own excellence; considering oneself above others or above God's law. Pride is the root of all sin.</p>
<ul><li>Examples: vanity, boasting, ambition for praise, refusing correction, contempt for others, disobedience to God</li></ul>

<h3>2. Avarice / Greed (<em>Avaritia</em>)</h3>
<p>Disordered attachment to material wealth and possessions.</p>
<ul><li>Examples: hoarding, refusing alms to the needy, obsession with money, dishonesty for gain, simony</li></ul>

<h3>3. Lust (<em>Luxuria</em>)</h3>
<p>Disordered desire for sexual pleasure.</p>
<ul><li>Examples: fornication, adultery, impure thoughts deliberately entertained, pornography, immodesty</li></ul>

<h3>4. Anger / Wrath (<em>Ira</em>)</h3>
<p>Disordered desire for vengeance.</p>
<ul><li>Examples: uncontrolled rage, grudges, revenge, quarreling, road rage, physical violence</li></ul>

<h3>5. Gluttony (<em>Gula</em>)</h3>
<p>Disordered desire for food and drink.</p>
<ul><li>Examples: habitual overeating, drunkenness, eating with excessive fastidiousness, refusing to fast when required</li></ul>

<h3>6. Envy (<em>Invidia</em>)</h3>
<p>Sadness at another's good fortune; desire that another be deprived of their goods.</p>
<ul><li>Examples: resentment of others' success, rejoicing at others' misfortune (Schadenfreude), backbiting motivated by jealousy</li></ul>

<h3>7. Sloth (<em>Acedia</em>)</h3>
<p>Spiritual apathy; sorrow in the face of the spiritual good.</p>
<ul><li>Examples: neglect of prayer, laziness in spiritual duties, missing Mass through indifference, boredom with the things of God, despair as a fruit of sloth</li></ul>

<p class="source">Cf. <em>Summa Theologica</em>, I-II, q. 84, a. 3–4; St. Gregory the Great, <em>Moralia in Job</em>, XXXI, xlv.</p>

<h2 id="cry-to-heaven">Sins That Cry to Heaven for Vengeance</h2>
<p>These sins are singled out in Sacred Scripture as particularly grievous offenses that "cry out" to God for justice:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Willful murder</strong> — <em>"The voice of thy brother's blood crieth to Me from the earth"</em> (Genesis 4:10)</li>
  <li><strong>The sin of Sodom</strong> (sodomy) — <em>"The cry of Sodom and Gomorrha is multiplied, and their sin is become exceedingly grievous"</em> (Genesis 18:20)</li>
  <li><strong>Oppression of the poor</strong> — <em>"Thou shalt not molest a stranger… You shall not hurt a widow or an orphan. If you hurt them, they will cry out to Me, and I will hear their cry"</em> (Exodus 22:21–23)</li>
  <li><strong>Defrauding laborers of their wages</strong> — <em>"Behold the hire of the labourers… which by fraud hath been kept back by you, crieth: and the cry of them hath entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth"</em> (James 5:4)</li>
</ol>
<p class="source">Cf. Roman Catechism, Part III, "The Fifth Commandment"; <em>Catechismus Romanus</em>, III, 4.</p>

<h2 id="reserved">Reserved Sins</h2>
<p>Certain grave sins are "reserved" — meaning that absolution for them is reserved to the bishop or even to the Holy See, and an ordinary confessor cannot absolve them without special faculties.</p>

<h3>Sins Reserved to the Holy See (incurring automatic excommunication — <em>latæ sententiæ</em>)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Apostasy, heresy, or schism</li>
  <li>Desecration of the Sacred Species (throwing away or retaining for a sacrilegious purpose the consecrated Host or Precious Blood)</li>
  <li>Physical violence against the Roman Pontiff</li>
  <li>A priest who absolves his accomplice in a sin against the Sixth Commandment</li>
  <li>A bishop who consecrates another bishop without papal mandate (and the bishop who receives such consecration)</li>
  <li>Direct violation of the seal of confession by a confessor</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sins Reserved to the Bishop</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Procuring a successful abortion (excommunication <em>latæ sententiæ</em>)</li>
  <li>Various cases as determined by local diocesan law</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">In danger of death, any priest can absolve from all sins and censures, including those reserved to the Holy See (1917 CIC, Can. 882).</p>

<p class="source">Cf. 1917 Code of Canon Law, Canons 893–900, 2314, 2320, 2325, 2338, 2367, 2369.</p>

<h2 id="occasions">Near Occasions of Sin</h2>
<p>A <strong>near occasion of sin</strong> is any person, place, thing, or circumstance that readily leads or strongly tempts one to sin. Catholic moral theology distinguishes:</p>

<h3>Proximate vs. Remote Occasions</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Proximate occasion</strong>: one in which a person almost always falls into sin, or in which most people would be expected to sin. One is <em>obliged</em> to avoid proximate occasions of sin.</li>
  <li><strong>Remote occasion</strong>: one in which the danger of sinning is present but not overwhelming. Prudence requires caution, but these need not always be avoided absolutely.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Voluntary vs. Necessary Occasions</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Voluntary</strong>: occasions one freely chooses (e.g., entering a place of temptation). These must be abandoned.</li>
  <li><strong>Necessary</strong>: occasions one cannot easily avoid (e.g., a workplace environment). In these cases, one must take extra precautions — prayer, vigilance, sacraments — to resist temptation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Obligation to Avoid Occasions</h3>
<p>It is a <strong>serious moral obligation</strong> to avoid voluntary proximate occasions of mortal sin. Deliberately and without necessity placing oneself in such an occasion is itself sinful. A confessor is bound to inquire about occasions of sin and to withhold absolution from a penitent who refuses to abandon a voluntary proximate occasion.</p>

<blockquote>"He that loveth danger shall perish in it." — Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) 3:27</blockquote>
