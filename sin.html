<h2 id="mortal-venial">Mortal and Venial Sin</h2>
<p>Not all sins are equal. The Church has always distinguished between <strong>mortal sin</strong>, which kills the life of grace in the soul, and <strong>venial sin</strong>, which weakens but does not destroy it.</p>

<blockquote>"There is a sin unto death… and there is a sin not unto death." — 1 St. John 5:16–17</blockquote>

<h3>Mortal Sin</h3>
<p>Mortal sin is a grave violation of God's law that destroys sanctifying grace in the soul and turns the sinner away from God, his ultimate end. A person in the state of mortal sin, if he dies unrepentant, merits eternal damnation.</p>

<blockquote>"The wages of sin is death." — Romans 6:23</blockquote>

<p>The effects of mortal sin:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Loss of sanctifying grace</strong> — the soul is spiritually dead</li>
  <li><strong>Loss of merit</strong> — all previous merits are rendered "dead" (though they revive upon restoration to grace)</li>
  <li><strong>Loss of the right to Heaven</strong> and liability to eternal punishment in Hell</li>
  <li><strong>Debt of temporal punishment</strong>, even after the sin is forgiven</li>
  <li><strong>Darkening of the intellect</strong> and weakening of the will, making further sin easier</li>
</ul>

<h3>Venial Sin</h3>
<p>Venial sin offends God and wounds the soul but does not destroy grace or merit eternal punishment. It does, however, incur <em>temporal punishment</em> (purified in this life or in Purgatory), weakens the will, inclines the soul toward mortal sin, and diminishes fervor in charity.</p>

<blockquote>"He that contemneth small things shall fall by little and little." — Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) 19:1</blockquote>

<p>St. Thomas Aquinas teaches that venial sin disposes the soul to mortal sin as a disease, left untreated, can become fatal (<em>Summa Theologica</em>, I-II, q. 88, a. 3).</p>

<p class="note"><strong>No venial sin should be treated lightly.</strong> St. Teresa of Ávila said: "I would rather die a thousand deaths than commit one deliberate venial sin." The saints understood that even small offenses against infinite Goodness are deeply serious.</p>

<p class="source">Cf. Council of Trent, Session VI, Chs. 11, 15; Session XIV, Ch. 5; <em>Summa Theologica</em>, I-II, qq. 72, 87–89; Roman Catechism, Part IV, Ch. 14.</p>

<h2 id="conditions">The Three Conditions for Mortal Sin</h2>
<p>For a sin to be mortal, <strong>all three</strong> of the following conditions must be present simultaneously. If any one is lacking, the sin is venial (though still sinful).</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h3>1. Grave Matter (<em>Materia Gravis</em>)</h3>
    <p>The act itself must be seriously wrong — a grave violation of God's law. The Ten Commandments provide the primary measure of grave matter. Examples include murder, adultery, apostasy, sacrilege, theft of significant amounts, deliberate hatred of God or neighbor, and perjury.</p>
    <p>The gravity of matter is <strong>objective</strong> — it does not depend on the sinner's feelings but on the nature of the act itself as measured by divine and natural law.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>2. Full Knowledge (<em>Plena Advertentia</em>)</h3>
    <p>The sinner must know (or should have known) that the act is gravely sinful. Ignorance can diminish or even remove culpability — but only if the ignorance is truly <strong>invincible</strong> (i.e., the person could not reasonably have known). Willful or negligent ignorance ("I didn't want to know") does not excuse.</p>
    <blockquote>"If I had not come, and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin." — St. John 15:22</blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>3. Deliberate Consent (<em>Plenus Consensus</em>)</h3>
    <p>The sinner must freely choose to commit the act. Factors that can diminish consent include: extreme fear, force, habit (though one is responsible for cultivating sinful habits), passion, and mental illness. However, these factors diminish but do not automatically eliminate culpability.</p>
    <p>St. Thomas notes that passion that <em>precedes</em> the act of the will diminishes voluntariness, while passion that is <em>deliberately aroused</em> increases it (<em>Summa Theologica</em>, I-II, q. 77, a. 6).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="source">Cf. <em>Summa Theologica</em>, I-II, q. 88, a. 1–2; Council of Trent, Session VI, Ch. 15; Roman Catechism, Part III.</p>

<h2 id="commandments">Sins Against the Ten Commandments</h2>
<p>The Ten Commandments remain the fundamental moral framework. Below is a summary of the principal sins against each, useful for the <strong>examination of conscience</strong> before Confession.</p>

  <li>Cheating in business, contracts, or taxes</li>
  <li>Failure to make restitution for stolen or damaged goods</li>
  <li>Envy, greed, materialism</li>
  <li>Usury — charging unjust interest</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p class="source">Cf. Exodus 20:1–17; Deuteronomy 5:6–21; <em>Summa Theologica</em>, I-II, qq. 100–105; II-II, qq. 122–170; Roman Catechism, Part III.</p>

<h2 id="deadly">The Seven Deadly (Capital) Sins</h2>
<p>The seven deadly sins — more properly called the <strong>capital sins</strong> (<em>vitia capitalia</em>) — are not necessarily mortal sins in themselves, but they are the root vices from which all other sins spring. "Capital" comes from the Latin <em>caput</em> (head), because they are the heads or sources of other sins.</p>

<blockquote>"From the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies." — St. Matthew 15:19</blockquote>

<table>
<tr><th>Capital Sin</th><th>Contrary Virtue</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Pride</strong> (<em>Superbia</em>)</td><td>Humility</td><td>Disordered self-love; considering oneself above others and above God. The root of all sin (Ecclesiasticus 10:15). St. Augustine calls pride "the beginning of all sin."</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Avarice</strong> (<em>Avaritia</em>)</td><td>Generosity</td><td>Inordinate love of wealth and material possessions. "The desire of money is the root of all evils" (1 Timothy 6:10).</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Lust</strong> (<em>Luxuria</em>)</td><td>Chastity</td><td>Disordered desire for sexual pleasure. Blinds the mind and enslaves the will (cf. <em>Summa Theologica</em>, II-II, q. 153).</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Wrath</strong> (<em>Ira</em>)</td><td>Patience</td><td>Disordered anger seeking revenge. "The anger of man worketh not the justice of God" (St. James 1:20).</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Gluttony</strong> (<em>Gula</em>)</td><td>Temperance</td><td>Inordinate desire for food or drink. St. Gregory the Great identifies five species: eating too soon, too expensively, too much, too eagerly, or too daintily.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Envy</strong> (<em>Invidia</em>)</td><td>Charity</td><td>Sorrow at another's good fortune; desire to see others deprived. "Through the envy of the devil, death came into the world" (Wisdom 2:24).</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Sloth</strong> (<em>Acedia</em>)</td><td>Diligence</td><td>Spiritual laziness; disgust with spiritual goods; neglect of one's duties to God. The "noonday devil" of the Desert Fathers. A grave danger because it leads to abandonment of the spiritual life entirely.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>St. Gregory the Great (<em>Moralia in Job</em>, XXXI, 45) and St. Thomas Aquinas (<em>Summa Theologica</em>, I-II, q. 84, a. 4) both provide the classic enumeration and analysis of the capital sins.</p>

<p class="source">Cf. <em>Summa Theologica</em>, I-II, q. 84; II-II, qq. 132, 148, 153, 158, 162, 118, 35–36; St. John Cassian, <em>Conferences</em>, V.</p>

<h2 id="cry-to-heaven">Sins Crying to Heaven for Vengeance</h2>
<p>Sacred Scripture identifies certain sins as so grievous that they are said to "cry out" to God for justice. These are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Willful murder</strong> — <em>"The voice of thy brother's blood crieth to Me from the earth."</em> (Genesis 4:10)</li>
  <li><strong>The sin of Sodom</strong> (sodomy and sins against nature) — <em>"The cry of Sodom and Gomorrha is multiplied, and their sin is become exceedingly grievous."</em> (Genesis 18:20)</li>
  <li><strong>Oppression of the poor, widows, and orphans</strong> — <em>"You shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child. If you hurt them, they will cry out to Me, and I will hear their cry."</em> (Exodus 22:22–23)</li>
  <li><strong>Defrauding laborers of their wages</strong> — <em>"Behold the hire of the labourers… which by fraud has been kept back by you, crieth: and the cry of them hath entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth."</em> (St. James 5:4)</li>
</ol>

<p>These sins are singled out not because other mortal sins are trivial, but because these offenses have a particular malice that violates the fundamental order of justice and charity, attacking the most vulnerable or the very order of nature itself.</p>

<p class="source">Cf. Roman Catechism, Part III, Ch. 4; <em>Summa Theologica</em>, II-II, q. 154, a. 12; Catechism of the Catholic Church, §1867.</p>

<h2 id="reserved">Reserved Sins and Censures</h2>
<p>Certain grave sins carry automatic penalties (<em>censures</em>) under Canon Law, most notably <strong>excommunication</strong> (<em>excommunicatio latae sententiae</em>). These are "reserved" because absolution requires special faculties beyond those of an ordinary confessor.</p>

<h3>Sins Incurring Automatic Excommunication (1917 Code)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Apostasy, heresy, or schism</strong> (Can. 2314)</li>
  <li><strong>Procuring a completed abortion</strong> (Can. 2350) — this applies to the mother, the abortionist, and all who formally cooperate</li>
  <li><strong>Violation of the Blessed Sacrament</strong> — throwing away, taking, or retaining the consecrated species for a sacrilegious purpose (Can. 2320)</li>
  <li><strong>Physical violence against the Pope</strong> (Can. 2343)</li>
  <li><strong>A priest who directly violates the seal of Confession</strong> (Can. 2369)</li>
  <li><strong>Attempted ordination of a woman or attempted reception</strong></li>
</ul>

<p class="note">In danger of death, <strong>any priest</strong> can absolve from all sins and censures, even those normally reserved to the Holy See (1917 CIC, Can. 882). The Church never leaves a dying soul without recourse.</p>

<p class="source">Cf. 1917 Code of Canon Law, Book V; <em>Summa Theologica</em>, Suppl., q. 22.</p>

<h2 id="occasions">Near Occasions of Sin</h2>
<p>A <strong>near occasion of sin</strong> is any person, place, thing, or circumstance that easily leads one into sin. Catholic moral theology distinguishes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Proximate occasion</strong> — one in which a person almost always falls into sin (e.g., an alcoholic entering a bar alone)</li>
  <li><strong>Remote occasion</strong> — one in which there is some danger but the temptation is not overwhelming</li>
  <li><strong>Voluntary occasion</strong> — one that can be avoided</li>
  <li><strong>Necessary occasion</strong> — one that cannot easily be avoided (e.g., a sinful work environment one cannot leave)</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Obligation to Avoid Occasions of Sin</h3>
<p>One who freely and knowingly places himself in a <strong>proximate, voluntary</strong> occasion of mortal sin commits a sin against prudence and, in many cases, sins by the very act of placing himself in danger. A firm purpose of amendment, required for valid Confession, necessarily includes the resolve to avoid near occasions of sin.</p>

<blockquote>"He that loveth danger shall perish in it." — Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) 3:27</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Watch ye, and pray that ye enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh weak." — St. Matthew 26:41</blockquote>

<p>St. Alphonsus Liguori, the Doctor of Moral Theology, teaches that confessors should refuse absolution to penitents who will not abandon voluntary proximate occasions of mortal sin, because their purpose of amendment cannot be considered sincere (<em>Theologia Moralis</em>, VI, n. 452).</p>

<h3>Practical Examples</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Keeping company with persons who habitually lead one into sin</li>
  <li>Reading books, watching programs, or visiting websites that routinely occasion impure thoughts</li>
  <li>Frequenting places where one habitually falls (bars, parties, etc.)</li>
  <li>Remaining in an illicit relationship</li>
  <li>Keeping objects associated with occult practices</li>
</ul>

<h3>Remedies</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Flight</strong> — the primary remedy. Remove yourself from the occasion. St. Philip Neri said: "In the matter of purity, there is no greater danger than not fearing the danger."</li>
  <li><strong>Prayer</strong> — especially the Rosary, invocation of Our Lady, and frequent reception of the sacraments</li>
  <li><strong>Mortification</strong> — voluntary penance strengthens the will against temptation</li>
  <li><strong>Frequent Confession</strong> — a powerful aid against habitual sin</li>
  <li><strong>Spiritual direction</strong> — the guidance of a wise confessor</li>
</ul>

<div class="prayer">
<span class="prayer-title">Act of Contrition</span>
O my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee, and I detest all my sins because I dread the loss of heaven and the pains of hell; but most of all because they offend Thee, my God, Who art all-good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace, to confess my sins, to do penance, and to amend my life. Amen.
