<h2 id="what">What Are Indulgences?</h2>
<p>An indulgence is the remission before God of the <em>temporal punishment</em> due to sins whose guilt has already been forgiven. It is granted by the Church from the treasury of the merits of Christ and the saints.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Important distinction:</strong> An indulgence does not forgive sin itself. Sin must first be forgiven through the Sacrament of Penance (Confession). An indulgence remits the <em>temporal punishment</em> that remains even after the guilt of sin is absolved.</p>

<p>The basis for indulgences is the power of binding and loosing given by Christ to His Church: <em>"Whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, it shall be bound also in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose upon earth, it shall be loosed also in heaven"</em> (Matthew 16:19).</p>

<p>The Church draws upon the infinite merits of Christ and the superabundant merits of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the saints — collectively called the <strong>Treasury of the Church</strong> (<em>Thesaurus Ecclesiæ</em>) — to remit this temporal punishment.</p>
<p class="source">Cf. Council of Trent, Session XXV, Decree on Indulgences (1563); Clement VI, <em>Unigenitus Dei Filius</em> (1343).</p>

<h2 id="partial-plenary">Partial and Plenary Indulgences</h2>

<h3>Partial Indulgence</h3>
<p>A partial indulgence removes <em>part</em> of the temporal punishment due to sin. Under the older system (pre-1967), partial indulgences were expressed in terms of days or years, corresponding to the equivalent period of canonical penance in the early Church. For example, "an indulgence of 300 days" meant a remission of temporal punishment equivalent to 300 days of the severe penances prescribed by the ancient canons.</p>

<h3>Plenary Indulgence</h3>
<p>A plenary indulgence removes <em>all</em> temporal punishment due to sin. To gain a plenary indulgence fully, one must have no attachment to any sin, even venial sin. If this disposition is incomplete, the indulgence becomes partial.</p>

<p class="source">Cf. 1917 Code of Canon Law, Canons 911–936.</p>

<h2 id="conditions">Conditions for Gaining Indulgences</h2>

<h3>General Conditions for Any Indulgence</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The person must be <strong>baptized</strong>, not excommunicated, and in the state of grace (at least at the completion of the prescribed work).</li>
  <li>The person must have the <strong>intention</strong> (at least general) of gaining the indulgence.</li>
  <li>The prescribed work must be <strong>performed</strong> as stipulated.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Usual Conditions for a Plenary Indulgence</h3>
<p>In addition to the prescribed work, a plenary indulgence typically requires:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Sacramental Confession</strong> — within about 20 days before or after the indulgenced work (one Confession suffices for multiple plenary indulgences).</li>
  <li><strong>Holy Communion</strong> — received on the day the indulgence is sought.</li>
  <li><strong>Prayer for the intentions of the Holy Father</strong> — typically one Our Father, one Hail Mary, and one Glory Be (or other prayers at the person's discretion).</li>
  <li><strong>Complete detachment from all sin</strong>, including venial sin — the most difficult condition, without which the indulgence becomes partial.</li>
</ol>

<p class="note">Only <strong>one</strong> plenary indulgence may be gained per day, except at the hour of death.</p>

<p class="source">Cf. <em>Enchiridion Indulgentiarum</em>; 1917 CIC, Can. 911 ff.</p>

<h2 id="prayers">Common Indulgenced Prayers and Acts</h2>

<h3>The Apostles' Creed</h3>
<div class="prayer">
<span class="prayer-title">Credo (Apostles' Creed)</span>
I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried; He descended into hell; on the third day He rose again from the dead; He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.

<h3>Act of Contrition</h3>
<div class="prayer">
<span class="prayer-title">Actus Contritionis</span>

  <li><strong>The <em>De Profundis</em></strong> (Psalm 129/130) for the Holy Souls — partial indulgence.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="raccolta">The Raccolta</h2>
<p>The <em>Raccolta</em> (Italian for "collection") is the official compendium of prayers and pious works to which the Holy See has attached indulgences. First published in 1807 and revised many times, it served as the authoritative reference for indulgenced devotions under the older system.</p>

<p>The <em>Raccolta</em> was organized into sections covering:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Acts of the theological and cardinal virtues</li>
  <li>Prayers to the Most Holy Trinity, to Our Lord, and to the Holy Spirit</li>
  <li>Devotions to the Blessed Sacrament</li>
  <li>Prayers to the Blessed Virgin Mary</li>
  <li>Prayers to the angels and saints</li>
  <li>Prayers for the faithful departed</li>
  <li>Various pious exercises (Stations, Rosary, litanies, novenas)</li>
</ul>

<p>After the reforms of Pope Paul VI in 1967 (<em>Indulgentiarum Doctrina</em>), the <em>Raccolta</em> was replaced by the <em>Enchiridion Indulgentiarum</em>, which simplified and reduced the number of specifically indulgenced prayers. Many traditional Catholics continue to use the <em>Raccolta</em> as a devotional guide.</p>

<p class="source">The last major edition: <em>Raccolta</em>, authorized English translation, 1957.</p>

<h2 id="holy-souls">Indulgences and the Holy Souls in Purgatory</h2>
<p>All indulgences may be applied to the <strong>Holy Souls in Purgatory</strong> <em>by way of suffrage</em> (<em>per modum suffragii</em>), unless otherwise stated. This means the faithful can offer the merits gained through indulgences to assist the departed souls still undergoing purification.</p>

<h3>How This Works</h3>
<p>When you gain an indulgence and offer it for the Holy Souls, you are petitioning God to apply the remission of temporal punishment to a soul in Purgatory rather than to yourself. The Church, through her authority over the Treasury of Merit, makes this transfer possible.</p>

<blockquote>"It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from sins." — 2 Machabees 12:46</blockquote>

<h3>Particularly Meritorious Acts for the Holy Souls</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Gaining a <strong>plenary indulgence</strong> and applying it to a particular soul or to the most abandoned souls</li>
  <li>Visiting a cemetery and praying for the dead (plenary indulgence, once per day, from November 1–8; partial indulgence at other times)</li>
  <li>The <strong>Heroic Act of Charity</strong>: a voluntary offering of all one's satisfactory works and all indulgences gained during life (and all suffrages offered after death) for the benefit of the Holy Souls. This act, while not a vow, is highly commended by the Church.</li>
  <li>Offering the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass for the departed</li>
  <li>Reciting the <em>De Profundis</em> or the <em>Eternal Rest</em> prayer</li>
</ul>

<p class="source">Cf. Council of Trent, Session XXV, Decree on Purgatory; Benedict XV, <em>Incruentum Altaris Sacrificium</em> (1915).</p>

<h2 id="history">Historical Context</h2>
<p>The doctrine of indulgences has deep roots in the early Church's penitential discipline. In the first centuries, Christians who committed grave sins (apostasy, murder, adultery) were required to undergo years — sometimes decades — of severe public penance before being reconciled. Bishops could shorten these penances based on the intercession of confessors and martyrs, drawing upon the treasury of merit won by their sufferings united to Christ's.</p>

<p>By the medieval period, the practice of commuting penances had developed into the formal system of indulgences. The theological foundation was clarified by Scholastic theologians, especially St. Thomas Aquinas (<em>Summa Theologica</em>, Suppl., q. 25–27), and authoritatively defined by Pope Clement VI in <em>Unigenitus Dei Filius</em> (1343), which taught the existence of the Treasury of the Church.</p>

<h3>The Abuses and Their Correction</h3>
<p>In the late medieval period, abuses crept in — most notoriously the scandalous preaching of Johann Tetzel, whose oversimplified fundraising slogans ("As soon as the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from Purgatory springs") provoked justified outrage. These abuses were <strong>condemned by the Church herself</strong>. The Council of Trent (Session XXV, 1563) ordered the elimination of all abuses connected with indulgences, forbade the granting of indulgences for financial considerations, and reaffirmed the underlying doctrine as sound and salutary.</p>

<blockquote>"The holy council commands that all evil gains for the obtaining of indulgences be wholly abolished… and that the abuses which have crept in… be amended and corrected." — Council of Trent, Session XXV</blockquote>

<h2 id="objections">Answering Protestant Objections</h2>

<h3>Objection: "Indulgences are selling forgiveness"</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Indulgences do not forgive sin — that is the province of the Sacrament of Penance alone. They remit <em>temporal punishment</em> remaining after sin is already forgiven. The sale of indulgences was an abuse condemned by the Church. The doctrine itself is not about money; it is about the Church's authority to bind and loose (Matthew 16:19) and the communion of saints sharing in Christ's merits.</p>

<h3>Objection: "Christ's sacrifice is sufficient — indulgences add to it"</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Christ's sacrifice is infinitely sufficient. Indulgences do not add to it; they <em>apply</em> its merits to individual souls through the Church's mediation. Just as the sacraments apply the merits of the Cross (even Protestants accept Baptism), so indulgences apply those merits to temporal punishment. The Treasury of the Church <em>is</em> the merit of Christ — it is not something apart from His sacrifice.</p>

<h3>Objection: "Temporal punishment has no scriptural basis"</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> David's sin with Bathsheba was forgiven, yet God still imposed temporal punishment — the death of the child (2 Kings [2 Samuel] 12:13–14). Moses was forgiven for striking the rock, yet was denied entry to the Promised Land (Numbers 20:12). The distinction between forgiveness of guilt and remission of punishment is thoroughly biblical. See also 1 Corinthians 3:15: "saved, yet so as by fire."</p>

<h3>Objection: "The Treasury of Merit is unbiblical"</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> St. Paul teaches that the sufferings of Christians have redemptive value when united to Christ: <em>"I… fill up those things that are wanting of the sufferings of Christ, in my flesh, for His body, which is the Church"</em> (Colossians 1:24). The members of Christ's Mystical Body share in His merits, and the Church, as steward of these riches, can distribute them for the benefit of her children.</p>
