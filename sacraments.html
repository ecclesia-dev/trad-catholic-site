<h2 id="overview">The Seven Sacraments</h2>
<p>The sacraments are outward signs instituted by Christ to give grace. They are the principal channels through which the merits of Christ's Passion are applied to individual souls. The Council of Trent solemnly defined that there are <strong>seven sacraments</strong>, no more and no less, all instituted by Our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<blockquote>"If anyone saith that the sacraments of the New Law were not all instituted by Jesus Christ our Lord… let him be anathema." — Council of Trent, Session VII, Canon 1</blockquote>

<h3>Matter and Form</h3>
<p>Each sacrament consists of <strong>matter</strong> (the visible element or action) and <strong>form</strong> (the words spoken). Together with the <strong>intention</strong> of the minister to do what the Church does, these constitute a valid sacrament.</p>

<h3>Categories</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sacraments of Initiation:</strong> Baptism, Confirmation, Holy Eucharist</li>
  <li><strong>Sacraments of Healing:</strong> Penance (Confession), Extreme Unction (Anointing of the Sick)</li>
  <li><strong>Sacraments of Vocation:</strong> Holy Orders, Matrimony</li>
</ul>

<p>Three sacraments — Baptism, Confirmation, and Holy Orders — imprint an indelible <strong>character</strong> on the soul and therefore can be received only once.</p>

<p class="source">Cf. Council of Trent, Session VII (1547); Roman Catechism, Part II; <em>Summa Theologica</em>, III, qq. 60–65.</p>

<!-- BAPTISM -->
<h2 id="baptism">I. Baptism (<em>Baptismus</em>)</h2>

<h3>What It Is</h3>
<p>Baptism is the first and most necessary sacrament, the gateway to all other sacraments and to the spiritual life itself. Through Baptism, original sin (and all actual sins, in the case of adults) is washed away, sanctifying grace is infused, and the baptized person is made a member of Christ's Mystical Body, the Church.</p>

<h3>Institution by Christ</h3>
<blockquote>"Going therefore, teach ye all nations: baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." — St. Matthew 28:19 (Douay-Rheims)</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Amen, amen I say to thee, unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." — St. John 3:5</blockquote>

<h3>Matter and Form</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Matter:</strong> Natural water, poured upon the head (or immersion)</li>
  <li><strong>Form:</strong> "I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost."</li>
</ul>

<h3>Minister</h3>
<p>The ordinary minister is a priest or deacon. In case of necessity (danger of death), <strong>anyone</strong> — even a non-Catholic or non-Christian — can validly baptize, provided they use the correct matter and form and intend to do what the Church does.</p>

<h3>Effects</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Remission of original sin and all actual sins</li>
  <li>Remission of all punishment due to sin (both eternal and temporal)</li>
  <li>Infusion of sanctifying grace, the theological virtues (faith, hope, charity), and the gifts of the Holy Spirit</li>
  <li>Imprinting of an indelible character, making one a Christian forever</li>
  <li>Incorporation into the Church</li>
</ul>

<h3>Baptism of Desire and Baptism of Blood</h3>
<p>The Church recognizes that, in extraordinary circumstances, the effects of Baptism may be received without the actual sacrament:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Baptism of Desire</strong> (<em>Baptismus Flaminis</em>): An explicit or implicit desire for Baptism, joined with perfect contrition, can supply for the sacrament when it cannot be received.</li>
  <li><strong>Baptism of Blood</strong> (<em>Baptismus Sanguinis</em>): Martyrdom for the Faith before receiving Baptism supplies for the sacrament.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>"The Church received from the Apostles the tradition of giving Baptism even to infants. For the Apostles, to whom were committed the secrets of divine mysteries, knew that there is in everyone the innate stain of sin, which must be washed away through water and the Spirit." — Origen, <em>Commentary on Romans</em>, V, 9 (c. A.D. 248)</blockquote>

<p class="source">Cf. Council of Trent, Session VII, Canons on Baptism; <em>Summa Theologica</em>, III, qq. 66–71; Roman Catechism, Part II, Ch. 2.</p>

<!-- CONFIRMATION -->
<h2 id="confirmation">II. Confirmation (<em>Confirmatio</em>)</h2>

<h3>What It Is</h3>
<p>Confirmation is the sacrament by which the baptized person is strengthened by the Holy Spirit to profess and defend the Faith courageously, as a soldier of Christ. It perfects the grace of Baptism.</p>

<h3>Institution</h3>
<blockquote>"But when the Paraclete cometh, whom I will send you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from the Father, He shall give testimony of Me." — St. John 15:26</blockquote>
<p>The Apostles received the fullness of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost (Acts 2:1–4), and in turn conferred the Spirit through the laying on of hands (Acts 8:14–17, 19:6).</p>

<h3>Matter and Form</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Matter:</strong> Anointing with sacred chrism (olive oil mixed with balsam, blessed by the bishop) on the forehead, with the laying on of hands</li>
  <li><strong>Form (Traditional):</strong> "I sign thee with the sign of the Cross, and I confirm thee with the chrism of salvation, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost."</li>
</ul>

<h3>Minister</h3>
<p>The ordinary minister is the <strong>bishop</strong>. A priest may confirm with special delegation.</p>

<h3>Effects</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Increase of sanctifying grace</li>
  <li>A special outpouring of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit: wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, fear of the Lord</li>
  <li>An indelible spiritual character</li>
  <li>Strength to witness to Christ and defend the Faith</li>
</ul>

<p class="source">Cf. Council of Trent, Session VII, Canons on Confirmation; <em>Summa Theologica</em>, III, qq. 72; Roman Catechism, Part II, Ch. 3.</p>

<!-- HOLY EUCHARIST -->
<h2 id="eucharist">III. The Holy Eucharist (<em>Sanctissima Eucharistia</em>)</h2>

<h3>What It Is</h3>
<p>The Holy Eucharist is the greatest of all the sacraments because it contains not merely grace but the <strong>Author of grace Himself</strong> — Jesus Christ, truly, really, and substantially present: Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity. The Eucharist is simultaneously a sacrament, a sacrifice (the Holy Mass), and the abiding presence of Christ in the tabernacle.</p>

<h3>Institution</h3>
<blockquote>"And whilst they were at supper, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke: and gave to His disciples, and said: Take ye, and eat. This is My Body. And taking the chalice, He gave thanks, and gave to them, saying: Drink ye all of this. For this is My Blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many unto remission of sins." — St. Matthew 26:26–28</blockquote>

<h3>Matter and Form</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Matter:</strong> Wheaten bread (unleavened in the Latin Rite) and grape wine (with a small amount of water)</li>
  <li><strong>Form:</strong> The words of consecration: "This is My Body" and "This is the chalice of My Blood, of the new and eternal testament, the mystery of faith, which shall be shed for you and for many unto the remission of sins."</li>
</ul>

<h3>Transubstantiation</h3>
<p>At the words of consecration, the entire substance of the bread is changed into the Body of Christ and the entire substance of the wine into His Blood. Only the accidents (appearances) of bread and wine remain. This change is called <strong>transubstantiation</strong>.</p>

<h3>Conditions for Worthy Reception</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The communicant must be in the <strong>state of grace</strong> (free from mortal sin). To receive in mortal sin is itself a mortal sin of sacrilege.</li>
  <li><strong>Eucharistic fast:</strong> Traditionally, complete fast from midnight; under the 1957 discipline, three hours for solid food, one hour for liquids (water and medicine excepted).</li>
  <li>Right intention and reverence</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>"Therefore whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the Body and of the Blood of the Lord." — 1 Corinthians 11:27</blockquote>

<blockquote>"They [the Gnostics] abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer, because they do not confess that the Eucharist is the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which flesh suffered for our sins and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up again." — St. Ignatius of Antioch, <em>Letter to the Smyrnaeans</em>, 7 (c. A.D. 110)</blockquote>

<p class="source">Cf. Council of Trent, Session XIII (on the Eucharist) and Session XXII (on the Sacrifice of the Mass); <em>Summa Theologica</em>, III, qq. 73–83; St. John 6:48–71.</p>

<!-- PENANCE -->
<h2 id="penance">IV. Penance (<em>Pœnitentia</em>)</h2>

<h3>What It Is</h3>
<p>Penance, or Confession, is the sacrament by which sins committed after Baptism are forgiven through the absolution of the priest, who acts in the person of Christ. It is the ordinary means established by Christ for the forgiveness of mortal sins.</p>

<h3>Institution</h3>
<blockquote>"Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained." — St. John 20:23</blockquote>

<h3>Acts of the Penitent</h3>
<p>Three acts are required on the part of the penitent, constituting the "matter" of the sacrament:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Contrition</strong> (<em>Contritio</em>) — sincere sorrow for having offended God, with a firm resolve not to sin again. <em>Perfect contrition</em> (sorrow from love of God) can remit mortal sin even before confession, provided one intends to confess. <em>Imperfect contrition</em> (attrition — sorrow from fear of punishment) suffices within the sacrament.</li>
  <li><strong>Confession</strong> (<em>Confessio</em>) — the telling of one's sins to the priest. All mortal sins must be confessed in kind and number, as far as memory permits. Deliberate concealment of a mortal sin renders the confession invalid and sacrilegious.</li>
  <li><strong>Satisfaction</strong> (<em>Satisfactio</em>) — the performing of the penance assigned by the confessor, which partially satisfies the temporal punishment due to sin.</li>
</ol>

<h3>The Form: Absolution</h3>
<p>The priest pronounces the formula of absolution: <em>"Ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis, in nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amen."</em> ("I absolve thee from thy sins, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.")</p>

<h3>The Seal of Confession</h3>
<p>The priest is bound by the <strong>sacramental seal</strong> (<em>sigillum sacramentale</em>) to absolute secrecy regarding everything revealed in confession. A priest who directly violates the seal incurs automatic excommunication reserved to the Holy See. No authority on earth — civil or ecclesiastical — can compel a priest to break the seal, for any reason whatsoever.</p>

<h3>How Often to Confess</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>minimum</strong> obligation is once a year, if one is conscious of mortal sin (the "Easter duty").</li>
  <li>One should confess <strong>as soon as possible</strong> after committing a mortal sin.</li>
  <li><strong>Frequent confession</strong> (weekly or biweekly) is strongly encouraged, even of venial sins only, as a powerful means of spiritual growth.</li>
</ul>

<p class="source">Cf. Council of Trent, Session XIV (1551); <em>Summa Theologica</em>, III, qq. 84–90; 1917 CIC, Canons 870–936.</p>

<!-- EXTREME UNCTION -->
<h2 id="extreme-unction">V. Extreme Unction (<em>Extrema Unctio</em>)</h2>

<h3>What It Is</h3>
<p>Extreme Unction (the "Last Anointing") is the sacrament for the seriously ill or dying, conferring grace, spiritual strength, and (if God wills) bodily healing. It completes the work of Penance by remitting the remnants of sin and preparing the soul for entry into glory.</p>

<h3>Institution</h3>
<blockquote>"Is any man sick among you? Let him bring in the priests of the Church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith shall save the sick man: and the Lord shall raise him up: and if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him." — St. James 5:14–15</blockquote>

<h3>Matter and Form</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Matter:</strong> Anointing with the Oil of the Sick (olive oil blessed by the bishop) on the five senses: eyes, ears, nostrils, mouth, hands (and feet, when possible).</li>
  <li><strong>Form:</strong> "Through this holy unction and His own most tender mercy, may the Lord pardon thee whatever thou hast sinned by sight [hearing, smell, taste and speech, touch, walking]." (<em>Per istam sanctam unctionem…</em>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Who May Receive It</h3>
<p>Any baptized Catholic who has reached the use of reason and is in danger of death from illness or old age. It is <strong>not</strong> limited to those on the very point of death — it should be received while the person is still conscious if possible. It may be repeated if the person recovers and falls ill again.</p>

<h3>Effects</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Increase of sanctifying grace</li>
  <li>Remission of venial sins and (if the person is unable to confess) even mortal sins, provided there is at least imperfect contrition</li>
  <li>Remission of the remnants of sin (temporal punishment)</li>
  <li>Strength and courage to endure suffering and resist temptation</li>
  <li>Restoration of bodily health, if God sees it expedient for the salvation of the soul</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">Do not delay calling a priest when someone is seriously ill! It is better to receive this sacrament "too early" than to be deprived of it by waiting too long.</p>

<p class="source">Cf. Council of Trent, Session XIV, Doctrine on Extreme Unction; <em>Summa Theologica</em>, Suppl., qq. 29–33; 1917 CIC, Canons 937–947.</p>

<!-- HOLY ORDERS -->
<h2 id="holy-orders">VI. Holy Orders (<em>Ordo</em>)</h2>

<h3>What It Is</h3>
<p>Holy Orders is the sacrament by which men are ordained to the sacred ministry as deacons, priests, or bishops, receiving the power and grace to perform their sacred functions — above all, to offer the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and to forgive sins.</p>

<h3>Institution</h3>
<blockquote>"Do this for a commemoration of Me." — St. Luke 22:19</blockquote>
<blockquote>"As the Father hath sent Me, I also send you… Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them." — St. John 20:21–23</blockquote>

<h3>The Three Degrees</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Episcopate (Bishop)</strong> — the fullness of the priesthood. Bishops are the successors of the Apostles and possess the power to ordain, confirm, and govern.</li>
  <li><strong>Presbyterate (Priest)</strong> — shares in the bishop's priesthood. The priest can offer Mass, absolve sins, baptize, preach, and administer most sacraments.</li>
  <li><strong>Diaconate (Deacon)</strong> — an order of ministry. The deacon assists at Mass, can baptize, preach, and distribute Holy Communion, but cannot offer Mass or absolve sins.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Minor Orders and Subdiaconate</h3>
<p>In the traditional discipline, there are also four <strong>minor orders</strong> (porter, lector, exorcist, acolyte) and the <strong>subdiaconate</strong>, constituting stages of formation before the diaconate. The subdiaconate entails the obligation of celibacy and the Divine Office.</p>

<h3>Who May Be Ordained</h3>
<p>Only a baptized <strong>male</strong> (Latin: <em>vir</em>) can validly receive Holy Orders. This is not a matter of discipline that the Church could change, but a truth rooted in the will of Christ, who chose only men as His Apostles, and in the unbroken Tradition of the Church.</p>

<p class="source">Cf. Council of Trent, Session XXIII (1563); <em>Summa Theologica</em>, Suppl., qq. 34–40; Pius XII, <em>Sacramentum Ordinis</em> (1947).</p>

<!-- MATRIMONY -->
<h2 id="matrimony">VII. Matrimony (<em>Matrimonium</em>)</h2>

<h3>What It Is</h3>
<p>Matrimony is the sacrament by which a baptized man and a baptized woman are joined in a lifelong, exclusive union for the procreation and education of children and for their mutual support. Christ elevated the natural institution of marriage to the dignity of a sacrament.</p>

<h3>Institution</h3>
<blockquote>"What therefore God hath joined together, let no man put asunder." — St. Matthew 19:6</blockquote>
<blockquote>"This is a great sacrament; but I speak in Christ and in the Church." — Ephesians 5:32</blockquote>

<h3>Essential Properties</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Unity</strong> — marriage is between one man and one woman (no polygamy)</li>
  <li><strong>Indissolubility</strong> — a valid, consummated sacramental marriage cannot be dissolved by any human power. Only death ends the bond.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Ends of Marriage</h3>
<p>According to the traditional ordering (1917 CIC, Canon 1013):</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Primary end:</strong> The procreation and education of children</li>
  <li><strong>Secondary end:</strong> Mutual help and the remedy of concupiscence</li>
</ol>

<h3>Impediments</h3>
<p>The Church recognizes various impediments that can render a marriage invalid (diriment impediments) or illicit (prohibiting impediments). These include consanguinity, existing bond, disparity of cult (marriage between a Catholic and an unbaptized person), sacred orders, and others.</p>

<h3>The Minister</h3>
<p>In the Latin Rite, the spouses themselves are the ministers of the sacrament — they confer the sacrament on each other through their mutual consent. The priest serves as the Church's official witness. For validity, a Catholic must marry before a priest (or bishop) and two witnesses (the canonical form).</p>

<h3>Divorce and Annulment</h3>
<p>The Church does not and <em>cannot</em> grant divorce, because a valid sacramental marriage is indissoluble. A declaration of <strong>nullity</strong> (annulment) is a finding that the marriage was <em>never valid</em> in the first place — due to a defect of consent, form, or the presence of a diriment impediment. It does not dissolve a marriage but declares that no sacramental bond existed.</p>

<p class="source">Cf. Council of Trent, Session XXIV (1563); <em>Summa Theologica</em>, Suppl., qq. 41–68; Pius XI, <em>Casti Connubii</em> (1930); 1917 CIC, Canons 1012–1143.</p>
