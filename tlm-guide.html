<h2 id="what-to-expect">What to Expect at the Traditional Latin Mass</h2>

<p>If you have never attended the Traditional Latin Mass (TLM), also called the Tridentine Mass or <em>Usus Antiquior</em>, it can seem unfamiliar at first. Do not be discouraged. The Mass is the same Holy Sacrifice of Calvary whether you understand every word or not. Here is what you need to know.</p>

<h3>First Impressions</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Mass is in Latin.</strong> Most parishes provide hand missals (books) with Latin on one side and English on the other. Some provide booklets for newcomers.</li>
  <li><strong>The priest faces the altar</strong> (<em>ad orientem</em> — "toward the East"), not the people. He and the congregation face God together. This is not the priest "turning his back" on the people; it is everyone facing the same direction in prayer.</li>
  <li><strong>Much of the Mass is prayed silently</strong> (especially the Canon). This is intentional — the sacred silence draws the faithful into deeper interior prayer and adoration of the mystery being enacted on the altar.</li>
  <li><strong>There is no "participation" in the modern sense</strong> of constant singing and responding. True participation is interior: uniting your heart to the Sacrifice, following along in the missal, praying the Rosary, or simply adoring in silence.</li>
  <li><strong>Gregorian chant</strong> and sacred polyphony are the music of the Roman Rite. You may also hear organ music. Contemporary hymns are not used.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="types">Types of Traditional Latin Mass</h2>

<h3>Low Mass (<em>Missa Lecta</em>)</h3>
<p>The simplest form. The priest reads all the prayers; there is no singing. One or two servers assist. The faithful follow along in their missals. Duration: typically 30–45 minutes.</p>

<h3>Sung Mass / High Mass (<em>Missa Cantata</em>)</h3>
<p>The priest sings the prayers; the choir sings the Proper (Introit, Gradual, etc.) and the Ordinary (Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, Agnus Dei). Incense may be used. One or more servers assist. Duration: typically 45–75 minutes.</p>

<h3>Solemn High Mass (<em>Missa Solemnis</em>)</h3>
<p>The most elaborate form. The celebrant is assisted by a deacon and subdeacon. Incense is used extensively. The full ceremonial of the Roman Rite is displayed. Duration: typically 75–90+ minutes.</p>

<h3>Pontifical Mass</h3>
<p>A Solemn Mass celebrated by a bishop, with additional ceremonies and ministers proper to the episcopal office.</p>

<h2 id="parts">The Parts of the Mass</h2>

<p>The Traditional Latin Mass has a fixed structure, divided into two great parts:</p>

<h3>I. The Mass of the Catechumens (<em>Missa Catechumenorum</em>)</h3>
<p>So named because in the early Church, catechumens (those not yet baptized) were permitted to attend this portion before being dismissed.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Prayers at the Foot of the Altar</strong> — The priest and servers recite Psalm 42 (<em>Judica me</em>) and the <em>Confiteor</em> (confession of sins). This is the penitential preparation.</li>
  <li><strong>The Introit</strong> — An antiphon proper to the day, chanted or recited as the priest ascends the altar.</li>
  <li><strong>Kyrie Eleison</strong> — "Lord, have mercy" — sung or recited nine times (three invocations each to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit).</li>
  <li><strong>Gloria in Excelsis Deo</strong> — "Glory to God in the highest" — the angelic hymn (omitted in penitential seasons and Requiem Masses).</li>
  <li><strong>The Collect(s)</strong> — The prayer(s) proper to the day, gathering the intentions of the faithful.</li>
  <li><strong>The Epistle</strong> — A reading from the Apostolic letters or Old Testament.</li>
  <li><strong>The Gradual, Alleluia, or Tract</strong> — Chants between the readings (the Tract replaces the Alleluia in penitential seasons).</li>
  <li><strong>The Gospel</strong> — Read from the Gospel of the day. The faithful stand.</li>
  <li><strong>The Sermon</strong> (if any) — Preaching in the vernacular.</li>
  <li><strong>The Credo</strong> — The Nicene Creed (on Sundays and major feasts).</li>
</ol>

<h3>II. The Mass of the Faithful (<em>Missa Fidelium</em>)</h3>
<p>The sacrificial heart of the Mass, from which unbaptized persons were historically excluded.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>The Offertory</strong> — The bread and wine are offered to God with explicitly sacrificial prayers. The priest prays that the sacrifice may be acceptable.</li>
  <li><strong>The Secret(s)</strong> — Prayers said silently over the offerings.</li>
  <li><strong>The Preface and Sanctus</strong> — A great prayer of thanksgiving leading into the thrice-holy hymn: <em>"Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus Dominus Deus Sabaoth…"</em></li>
  <li><strong>The Canon of the Mass</strong> — The unchanging Eucharistic Prayer of the Roman Rite, prayed silently by the priest. Within the Canon occurs the <strong>Consecration</strong> — the moment when bread and wine become the Body and Blood of Christ. The server rings the bell; the faithful kneel and adore.</li>
  <li><strong>The Pater Noster</strong> — The Our Father, chanted by the priest.</li>
  <li><strong>The Fraction and Agnus Dei</strong> — The breaking of the Host and the threefold prayer: <em>"Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world, have mercy on us… grant us peace."</em></li>
  <li><strong>Holy Communion</strong> — The priest receives first, then distributes Communion to the faithful.</li>
  <li><strong>The Communion Antiphon and Postcommunion</strong> — Prayers of thanksgiving after Communion.</li>
  <li><strong>The Dismissal</strong> — <em>"Ite, missa est"</em> ("Go, the Mass is ended") or <em>"Benedicamus Domino"</em> in certain seasons.</li>
  <li><strong>The Last Gospel</strong> — The Prologue of St. John's Gospel (John 1:1–14) is read. The faithful genuflect at <em>"Et Verbum caro factum est"</em> ("And the Word was made flesh").</li>
  <li><strong>The Leonine Prayers</strong> — After Low Mass, the Hail Mary (thrice), Salve Regina, and the Prayer to St. Michael are recited (instituted by Pope Leo XIII).</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="responses">Server Responses (Low Mass)</h2>

<p>At a Low Mass, the server (and the faithful, if they wish) makes the following responses in Latin. Here are the most common:</p>

<div class="prayer">
<span class="prayer-title">At the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar</span>
<strong>Priest:</strong> In nómine Patris, et Fílii, et Spíritus Sancti. Amen. Introíbo ad altáre Dei.<br>
<strong>Server:</strong> <em>Ad Deum qui lætíficat juventútem meam.</em> (To God, who giveth joy to my youth.)
</div>

<div class="prayer">
<span class="prayer-title">Psalm 42 (alternating verses — the server's key response)</span>
<strong>P:</strong> Júdica me, Deus, et discérne causam meam de gente non sancta…<br>
<strong>S:</strong> <em>Quia tu es, Deus, fortitúdo mea: quare me repulísti, et quare tristis incédo, dum afflígit me inimícus?</em>
</div>

<div class="prayer">
<span class="prayer-title">The Confiteor (Server's Turn)</span>
<em>Confíteor Deo omnipoténti, beátæ Maríæ semper Vírgini, beáto Michaéli Archángelo, beáto Joánni Baptístæ, sanctis Apóstolis Petro et Paulo, ómnibus Sanctis, et tibi, Pater: quia peccávi nimis cogitatióne, verbo et ópere: mea culpa, mea culpa, mea máxima culpa. Ideo precor beátam Maríam semper Vírginem, beátum Michaélem Archángelum, beátum Joánnem Baptístam, sanctos Apóstolos Petrum et Paulum, omnes Sanctos, et te, Pater, oráre pro me ad Dóminum Deum nostrum.</em>
</div>

<div class="prayer">
<span class="prayer-title">Common Responses Throughout Mass</span>
<strong>P:</strong> Dóminus vobíscum. (The Lord be with you.)<br>
<strong>S:</strong> <em>Et cum spíritu tuo.</em> (And with thy spirit.)<br><br>
<strong>P:</strong> Orémus. (Let us pray.)<br>

<strong>P:</strong> Grátias agámus Dómino Deo nostro. (Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.)<br>
<strong>S:</strong> <em>Dignum et justum est.</em> (It is meet and just.)<br><br>
<strong>At the end of the Gospel:</strong><br>
<strong>S:</strong> <em>Laus tibi, Christe.</em> (Praise be to Thee, O Christ.)
</div>

<div class="prayer">
<span class="prayer-title">At the Dismissal</span>
<strong>P:</strong> Ite, Missa est. (Go, the Mass is ended.)<br>
<strong>S:</strong> <em>Deo grátias.</em> (Thanks be to God.)
</div>

<h2 id="communion">Receiving Holy Communion</h2>

<h3>Before Communion</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You must be in a <strong>state of grace</strong> (free from mortal sin). If not, do not receive — make a spiritual communion instead.</li>
  <li>Observe the <strong>Eucharistic fast</strong>: traditionally, nothing to eat or drink from midnight; under the 1957 discipline, three hours for food, one hour for non-water liquids. Water never breaks the fast.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Communion Procedure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>When the time comes, approach the altar rail and <strong>kneel</strong>.</li>
  <li>Place a <strong>communion cloth</strong> (paten cloth) under your chin, or the server will hold a paten beneath.</li>
  <li>Open your mouth, extend your <strong>tongue</strong> slightly. The priest will place the Host on your tongue. Do <strong>not</strong> reach out your hands.</li>
  <li>Close your mouth, allow the Host to dissolve or swallow reverently. Do not chew the Host.</li>
  <li>Return to your pew and <strong>kneel in thanksgiving</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p class="note"><strong>Non-Catholics:</strong> You may not receive Holy Communion at a Catholic Mass. You are welcome to remain in your pew during Communion, pray, and observe. You may also approach the rail with your arms crossed over your chest to receive a blessing (though this practice varies by parish).</p>

<h2 id="etiquette">Etiquette and Practical Tips</h2>

<h3>What to Wear</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Men:</strong> Dress shirt and slacks at minimum; suit and tie ideal. No shorts, flip-flops, or t-shirts.</li>
  <li><strong>Women:</strong> Modest dress or skirt (below the knee), sleeves covering at least the upper arms. A <strong>chapel veil or mantilla</strong> is the traditional head covering for women (cf. 1 Corinthians 11:5–6). Many parishes have spare veils available.</li>
  <li>Dress as if you were meeting a king — because you are meeting the King of Kings.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What to Bring</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A <strong>hand missal</strong> (e.g., the <em>1962 Roman Missal</em> or <em>St. Andrew Daily Missal</em>) is extremely helpful. Many parishes also provide red booklets for the Ordinary of the Mass.</li>
  <li>A <strong>Rosary</strong> — praying the Rosary during Mass is a perfectly acceptable form of participation, especially if you cannot follow the Latin.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Posture</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stand</strong> for the Gospel, the Credo, and when the priest says prayers standing.</li>
  <li><strong>Kneel</strong> from the Sanctus through the Consecration and Communion, and during the priest's Communion.</li>
  <li><strong>Sit</strong> during the Epistle, the sermon, and the Offertory (in a Low Mass).</li>
  <li>When in doubt, follow what the regulars do.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Genuflections and Signs of the Cross</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Genuflect</strong> (right knee to the floor) when entering or leaving a pew if the Blessed Sacrament is in the tabernacle.</li>
  <li><strong>Strike your breast</strong> three times at the <em>Confiteor</em> (<em>mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa</em>) and once at the <em>Agnus Dei</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Sign of the Cross</strong> at the beginning, at the Gospel, and at the final blessing.</li>
  <li>At the elevation of the Host and Chalice, <strong>look up</strong> at the Sacred Species and pray: <em>"My Lord and my God!"</em> (a partial indulgence).</li>
</ul>

Sancte Michaël Archángele, defénde nos in prǽlio; contra nequítiam et insídias diáboli esto præsídium.

Amen.<br><br>
<em>(Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle; be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray: and do thou, O Prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God, thrust into hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen.)</em>
